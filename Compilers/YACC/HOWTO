Before to go further, please download Bison and GCC.

HOW TO START THESE PROGRAMS
Let's take es1.y as example for the following HowTo. Open the shell and write
1. bison es1.y
2. gcc es1.tab.c -ly
3. ./a.out
4. (abaa) (or some other input)

IN GENERAL
1. Write the YACC program with extension .y
2. Note: do not write your code with errors, because they will not be taken over (for example, either bison and gcc toke over that I wrote a variable (contatore) instead of the decleared variable (counter) and output was everytime "Sintax error" and I got mad to understand why)
3. In the shell: bison es1.y; gcc es1.tab.c -ly; ./a.out (separate commands)
4. Write an input: (abaa)
5. Observe output and enjoy
