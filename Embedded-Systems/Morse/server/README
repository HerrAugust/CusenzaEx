WHAT IS SERVERINTELEDISON.JAVA?
This is the server for Morse.cpp, which is a program for Intel Edison (or equivalent boards) written in C++ and C.


-------------------------------
WHAT ARE SERVERINTELEDISON.CLASS AND LAUNCH.BAT?
The first one is the same file that you can obtain by opening Prompt (Windows) or a terminal (Linux) and compiling ServerIntelEdison.java.
The second one (you can open it with Gedit on Linux or Notepad on Windows) is a shortcut to launch ServerIntelEdison. It simply does for
you what you would do manually (see "how to compile the server"). It works perfectly on Windows; on Linux you should change its file extension.
In order to use launch.bat you must have Java JDK installed on your computer.

-------------------------------
HOW CAN I COMPILE AND RUN SERVERINTELEDISON.JAVA?
Be sure you have installed Java JDK (otherwise simply download and install it). Open Prompt (Windows) or a Terminal (Linux), move to the path
of ServerIntelEdison.java using "cd" and than "javac ServerIntelEdison.java" and than "java ServerIntelEdison".
For example, suppose ServerIntelEdison.java is in "C:\Users\Agostino\Workspace\iot\Morse\server". Install Java JDK, open Prompt or Terminal, write:

cd C:\Users\Agostino\Workspace\iot\Morse\server (press enter)
javac ServerIntelEdison.java (press enter)
java ServerIntelEdison (press enter)

Now enter a Morse string using your board (it must be connected to the Internet) and voil√†: ServerIntelEdison will receive the string and will open
a window in your browser. Enter the security code and listen to your string.
