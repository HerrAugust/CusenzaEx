Client connects to my IP address (no matter what version it is) and to port 50002. It sends to, say, the modem a message (read text), which in turn understands whose IP address the one to which client is connected is and sends the message to that IP address (me).
There must be only one process per port (50002), and the message has been sent to that port (50002). So the server can receive the message.

If my IP address is 10.192.1.1:
client connected to (10.192.1.1, ephemeral port) SEND
	|
	|
modem or so sends message to 10.192.1.1, at port 50002
	|
	|
server connected to (some address, 50002) RECEIVE
