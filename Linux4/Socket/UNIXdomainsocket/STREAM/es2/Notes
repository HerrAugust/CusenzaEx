Notes:
1) You can do in SERVER:
int clientfd = accept(fd, NULL, NULL);
...
write(clientfd, buf, strlen(buf)+1);

And so you can avoid to create an address for and connect to it in client. It is
like you did a bind()!

2) Everytime remeber that strlen() does not consider \0 and so you have to manually add it (strlen(buf)+1).
