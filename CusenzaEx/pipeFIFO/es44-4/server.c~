/*
 * Add code to the fifo_seqnum_server.c so that if the program receives the SIGINT or SIGTERM signals,
 * it removes the server FIFO and terminates.
 * Server reads from client the number to be added after the message to a int total form a certain fifo. Client determines
 * through its pid where the server must send the message, which contains total.
 * We will use one address to receive (see header) data and the one decided by the client to write data.
