My Exercises
=========
These all are my exercises. I have beginning doing them during II year of Bachelor. Hope someone can meet peace through them, just as I did.
Please do not treat bad all the source codes you freely download because it was very hard to code all them.

If you want to let me note some issue or so, you can send to me a message.

A brief collection of exercises about a basic course of Algorithms with Java. It are about List, Iterable, Comparable and Comparator interfaces and TreeMap, TreeSet, ArrayList, LinkedList and PriorityQueue JCF classes. It also contains class Network, which describes a directed network, and BinaryTree, which describes a binary tree made up of tree nodes with at the most two sub-trees.
I also included a class, <b>Visualizzatore</b>, which allows to graphically show a binary tree, which must be an instance of BinaryTree<E>.
